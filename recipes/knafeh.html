    <img src="../images/Kunafa.jpg" alt="Knafeh-image" height="300" width="auto">
    <p>Knafeh is a traditional Arabic dessert, made with spun pastry called kataifi, soaked in a sweet, sugar-based syrup called attar, and typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted cream, pistachio or nuts, depending on the region</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar - <em>1 Cup</em></li>
        <li>Water - <em>1/4 Cup</em></li>
        <li>Lemon Juice - <em>1 Squeeze</em></li>
        <li>Kataifi Dough(shredded phyllo dough) - <em>454 Grams</em></li>
        <li>Melted Butter - <em>1 Cup</em></li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese - <em>600 Grams</em></li>
        <li>Thick Cream - <em>170 Millileters</em></li>
        <li>Crushed Pistachios - <em>1/2 Cup</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the water, sugar and squeeze of lemon and place on high heat. Allow it to come to a boil</li>
        <li>Once it boils, lower heat to medium and allow it to simmer for 10 minutes then turn off the heat. It should have a runny syrup consistency (not too thick). Allow it to cool to room temperature on the counter</li>
        <li>Take out the frozen kataifi dough and leave it to thaw for an hour or so on the counter. Preheat oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Shred the cheese or cut it up into small cubes, and mix it with the thick cream</li>
        <li>Break up the kataifi dough and place it in a food processor. Whiz it for a few seconds until it is broken up into small pieces. If you don't own a food processor, you can do this with your hands or by cutting it up using a knife.</li>
        <li>Place the shredded kataifi dough in a bowl and pour over the melted butter. Using your hands, massage the butter into the dough making sure you saturate every strand. The better you incorporate it, the more evenly crispy it will be</li>
        <li>Brush the bottom of your pan with a bit of butter. Use a 12 inch pan for one large one or you can make 2x 9 inch ones</li>
        <li>Take half of the kataifi dough and pack it into the bottom of the pan using the flat bottom of a cup. Pack it to form a slight edge around the perimeter</li>
        <li>Spoon the cheese mixture inside and spread it out evenly</li>
        <li>Take the remaining kataifi dough and spread it over the cheese, covering it all and packing it in lightly</li>
        <li>Bake for 40-50 minutes or until the outside is deeply golden and crispy</li>
        <li>Immediately drizzle the knafeh with about 3/4 of the simple syrup, ensuring you cover the full surface. Reserve some syrup to the side for anyone who wants extra</li>
        <li>Allow it to cool and soak the syrup for 10 minutes or so, then invert it onto a serving platter (you can also keep it in the tray), garnish with pistachios, cut into pieces and serve</li>
    </ol>
